//! Shared wire types and the `OciProxy` client trait for the
//! `org.composefs.Oci` varlink interface.
//!
//! These types are defined here (in `composefs-oci`) rather than
//! `composefs-ctl` so that both the repo-side service (`CfsctlService` in
//! composefs-ctl) and the containers-storage service (`CstorLayerService` in
//! composefs-storage) can share the same proxy trait without creating a
//! dependency cycle.
//!
//! `composefs-ctl` re-exports everything from this module; callers should
//! prefer `composefs_oci::varlink_types` or the re-exports in
//! `composefs_ctl::varlink::{layer_sync,oci::OciError,proxy::OciProxy}`.
//!
//! # Feature gate
//!
//! This module is compiled only when the `varlink` feature is enabled on
//! `composefs-oci` (which pulls in `zlink`).
