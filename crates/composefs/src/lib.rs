//! # composefs: The reliability of disk images, the flexibility of files
//!
//! composefs combines several Linux kernel features to provide read-only
//! mountable filesystem trees that stack on top of a conventional "lower"
//! filesystem.
//!
//! ## Interfaces
//!
//! composefs offers two programmatic interfaces:
//!
//! - **Rust API** — this crate and its siblings (`composefs-oci`,
//!   `composefs-boot`, etc.), usable as regular Cargo dependencies.
//! - **Varlink API** — a [varlink](https://varlink.org) RPC interface
//!   exposed by `cfsctl varlink` over a Unix socket, accessible from
//!   any language.  See the [`varlink`] module for examples.
//!
//! Neither interface is declared stable yet.  Both may change across
//! releases while the project is under active development.
//!
//! ## Key technologies
//!
//! - **[overlayfs]** — the kernel mount interface that exposes the composed tree
//! - **[EROFS]** — an in-kernel read-only filesystem for the metadata tree
//!   (directories, symlinks, permissions, xattrs) with no file data
//! - **[fs-verity]** (optional) — per-file integrity verification on the
//!   backing store, validated by overlayfs at access time
//!
//! [overlayfs]: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt
//! [EROFS]: https://erofs.docs.kernel.org
//! [fs-verity]: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fsverity.html
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! composefs produces an EROFS image containing *only* metadata.  Non-empty
//! data files live in a content-addressed backing store, with
//! `trusted.overlay.redirect` xattrs telling overlayfs where to find them.
//! Identical files across images are stored once on disk and shared in the
//! Linux page cache.
//!
//! See the [`repository_format`] module for the on-disk layout.

#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
// This is a library: emit diagnostics via the `log` crate (or return them),
// never by writing to the process's stdout/stderr. Genuinely-intentional
// exceptions carry a local `#[allow]` with justification. Test code is exempt.
